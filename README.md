# 🦾 AI-Phantom Security Suite v4.0

![AI-Phantom Banner](logo.png)

**AI-Phantom** is a high-end, autonomous security research and penetration testing suite designed for the modern era. Developed by **Gautham.A** and **Abhijith.S**, it leverages advanced **Recursive Cognitive Reasoning** and **Hyper-Active Neural Fuzzing** to discover, exploit, and report vulnerabilities with human-like intelligence.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **🧠 Advanced Cognitive Architecture (V4.0):** Uses Multi-Step Recursive Reasoning to chain vulnerabilities and hypothesize multi-stage breach scenarios.
*   **🌪️ Full Spectrum Attack Suite:** Active injection testing for SQLi, XSS, LFI, SSRF, SSTI, RCE, and Open Redirects using world-class payloads from *PayloadsAllTheThings*.
*   **🔍 Deep Neural Fuzzing:** Systematically probes every URL parameter and HTML form field discovered during the recursive crawl.
*   **🛡️ High-End Tactical UI:** A professional, stealth-themed CLI interface powered by `rich` and `prompt_toolkit`, featuring progress bars, tables, and true-color rendering.
*   **🧬 Information Disclosure Engine:** Identifies leaked API keys, JWT tokens, and private secrets using ML-lite Entropy Analysis.
*   **🌐 Infrastructure Recon:** Automatic subdomain mesh discovery, port probing (Uplink detection), and technology stack profiling.
*   **📖 Autonomous Knowledge Base:** Generates actionable reports with unique PoCs (Proof of Concepts) and technical risk descriptions for every finding.

## 🛠️ Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-phantom.git
   cd ai-phantom
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) For dynamic rendering support:

   ```

## 🎮 Quick Start

Start the Phantom Neural Core:
```bash
python3 aiwebscanner.py
```

### Core Commands:
- `setup`: Configure your AI Neural Core (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, or Perplexity).
- `scan <url>`: Initialize a full-spectrum adversarial audit on a target.
- `scan file <path>`: Perform an AI-powered neural audit (SAST) on a local file.
- `report`: View the deduplicated Vulnerability Matrix and PoC dashboard.
- `ai`: Trigger the Red Team Lead AI for multi-stage attack chaining analysis.
- `export <file>`: Save all telemetry and findings to a JSON file.

## 🤖 Supported AI Providers
- **Gemini** (Google) - *Default high-speed cognitive engine*
